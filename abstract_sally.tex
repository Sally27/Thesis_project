\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent
This thesis presents a first search for the fully leptonic decay \Bmumumu in any experiment. This search is performed using
proton-proton collision data at LHCb corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $4.7$ fb$^{-1}$. The search is carried out in the
region where the minimum of the two $\mumu$ mass combinations is below $980$\mevcc. From the theoretical point of view, the measurement of the branching fraction of decay is interesting given that the recent theoretical prediction \cite{Danilina:2018uzr} of branching fraction for \Bmumumu of $1.3 \times 10^{-7}$ is high. Moreover this decay is sensitive to the magnitude of the quark coupling strenght between $b$ and $u$ quark, which is of great interest given that there are some tensions in measurements of this coupling strength.

The data shows to be consistent with the background only hypothesis and the limit $1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ at 95\% confidence level is set on the branching fraction in the stated kinematic region. This is therefore not consistent with the theoretical prediction made in \cite{Danilina:2018uzr}.

This thesis also presents a study of response of the detector if three muons pass through it. This study shows that correlations induced by a trimuon system in the detector are substantial and they need to be addressed properly.


%reports the branching fraction measurement of the rare Cabibbo-suppressed decay \Lbpi. The decay is observed for the first time with a $\SIG\sigma$ deviation from the background-only hypothesis. This is the first observation of a $b$\to$d$ quark transition in the baryon sector. The dataset used for the measurement corresponds to 3\:\invfb of \proton{}\proton collisions collected at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The branching fraction is measured using \Lb\to\jpsi(\to\mumu)\proton\pim as a normalisation channel and is measured as
%\begin{equation*}
%  \BF(\Lbpi) = \BFV,
%\end{equation*}
%where the first error is the statistical uncertainty, the second is the systematic uncertainty and the third is the uncertainty on $\BF(\Lbpijpsi)$.
%The measurement of $\BF(\Lbpi)$ can be combined with the branching fraction measurement for \LbK to give constraints on the ratio of CKM matrix elements $|\frac{\Vtd}{\Vts}|$. Such a determination of $|\frac{\Vtd}{\Vts}|$  requires a theory prediction for the ratio of the relevant form factors.

%This thesis also reports the ratio of tracking efficiencies, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{rel}}$, between data and simulation for $\KS\to\pip\pim$ decays occurring within the LHCb detector acceptance. As \KS particles are long-lived, their associated tracking efficiencies are less precisely determined compared to those of shorter-lived particles. The average value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{rel}}$ for $\KS\to\pip\pim$ decays, where the \KS has a flight distance of $\gsim 1\m$, is found to be
%\begin{equation*}
%  \epsilon_{\mathrm{rel}} = 0.70\pm0.02.
%\end{equation*}

% To perform this calibration measurement a novel technique was developed which has the potential to be used in measuring the value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{rel}}$ for other decays involving long-lived particles.

%The value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is found to be weakly dependent on the kinematics of the events as well as the particles decay position in the detector.
