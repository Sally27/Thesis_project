\chapter{Discovering (Setting Limit for) \Bmumumu at LHCb}
\label{chap:sel}

\textit{LHCb's flagship analyses contain several muons in the final state coming from differently flavoured $B$ mesons. Despite being in this category, search for \Bmumumu is limited by the rareness of its occurrence as well as different backgrounds that can mimic its signature in the detector. Moreover, presence of invisible neutrino does induce uncertainties into reconstruction. The following \autoref{chap:sel} will concentrate on characterisation of backgrounds as well as selection that is performed in order to reduce these backgrounds.}


\section{Topology of at LHCb \Bmumumu at LHCb \mybox{ULRIK}}

Upon hadronisation of $b\bar{b}$ pair \Bpm particle will travel less than a millimetre in the laboratory frame of reference before it decays into its decay products. This allows reconstruction of a primary vertex \gls{PV} and its decay vertex, \textit{secondary vertex} \gls{SV}. By joining these vertices, direction as well as length of the \Bpm existence, also known as flight distance (\gls{FD}), can be established. In order to infer information about kinematic properties of \Bpm, the decay products are studied. All three muons are used to reconstruct the visible four-momentum. By conservation of momentum with respects to the direction of the flight of \Bpm, neutrino is assigned all missing momentum transverse to the direction of the flight of \Bpm. The schematic diagram can be seen in \autoref{fig:sigtopolog}.

All charged tracks (in filled-blue) seen can be combined into four-vector representing the visible part of the decay (semi filled-blue). Information about invisible neutrino (semi filled-red) are deduced from the conservation of momentum with respect to the direction of the flight of \Bpm. Neglecting momentum component parallel to the direction of flight for neutrino, transverse component of momentum is given.}

Altogether available information allows for reconstruction of a quantity, \textit{corrected mass}, that plays similar role to invariant mass in fully reconstructed decays. Invariant mass is usually used in \gls{LHCb} as fitting distribution from which physics results are extracted. This particular quantity is used as it distinguishes well signal and background shapes with minimal modelling assumptions.

\textit{Corrected mass} is defined as

\begin{equation}
	M_{corr} = \sqrt{{M}^{2} + |p^{2}_{T}|} + |p_{T}|,
\end{equation}	
where the $M^{2}$ is the invariant visible mass squared and $p^{2}_{T}$ is the missing momentum squared transverse to the direction of $B^{+}$ flight. Usually the corrected mass of \Bpm will be denoted as $M_{B_{corr}}$.

%\begin{equation}
%M_{B_{corr}} = \sqrt{M_{\mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+}}^{2} + |p_{T}|} + |p_{T}|,
%\end{equation}	

$M_{corr}$ can be thought of as the minimal correction to the visible mass to account for the missing neutrino information. The resolution on the \textit{corrected mass} hence becomes a critical quantity that needs to be understood. As the method of reconstruction of corrected mass relies heavily on the knowledge of \Bpm flight direction, the resolution of \gls{PV} position and \gls{SV} vertex is crucial. Let $\vec{{x}}_{PV}=\{x_{PV},y_{PV},z_{PV}\}$, $\vec{{x}}_{SV}=\{x_{SV},y_{SV},z_{SV}\} $ be \gls{PV} and \gls{SV} vertex position and $\vec{p}=\{p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\}$ be the visible trimuon momentum. Then the missing transverse momentum to the direction of the flight $p_{T}$ (momentum of the neutrino) is


\begin{equation}
	p^{2}_{T} = |\vec{p} - (\vec{{x}}_{SV}-\vec{{x}}_{PV})\frac{\vec{p} \cdot(\vec{{x}}_{SV}-\vec{{x}}_{PV})}{|(\vec{{x}}_{SV}-\vec{{x}}_{PV})|^{2}}|^{2}
\end{equation}

In general in order to propagate error on $f(x,y,z)$, where $x,y,z$ are independent variables, the variance of $f(x,y,z)$

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\langle f^{2}-\langle f \rangle^{2} \rangle  &=  \langle f(x+\delta x, y+\delta y, z+\delta z)^{2} - f(\langle x \rangle, \langle y \rangle, \langle z \rangle)^{2} \rangle \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Using first order Taylor expansion of variance and rewriting into the matrix form:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
%	\langle \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}  \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} \times \delta x^{2} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}}  \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \times \delta y^{2} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}}  \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} \times \delta z^{2} + \sum_{i,j=1..3, i \neq j} \partial_{d_{i}} \partial_{d_{i}}  \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \rangle \\ 
%        = 
       \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} & \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} & \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} \\
       \end{bmatrix}
       \begin{bmatrix}
	       {\delta x}^{2} & \delta x \delta y & \delta x \delta z  \\ 
	        \delta y \delta x & {\delta y}^{2} & \delta y \delta z  \\
	        \delta z \delta x & \delta z \delta y & {\delta z}^{2}  \\
       \end{bmatrix}
       \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} \\ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \\\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} \\
       \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

So now assuming that $x=\vec{{x}}_{PV}$, $y=\vec{{x}}_{SV}$ and $z=\mathbold{\vec{p}}=\{E,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\}$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
       \nabla^{T}_{x_{PV}} \rm{COV_{x_{PV}}} \nabla_{x_{PV}} + \nabla^{T}_{x_{SV}} \rm{COV_{x_{SV}}} \nabla_{x_{SV}} + \nabla^{T}_{p} \rm{COV_{p}} \nabla_{p}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where \rm{COV} is the covariance matrix.

In conclusion in order to calculate error on \textit{corrected mass}, $\delta_{corrm}$


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{corrm} = \sqrt{ \langle f^{2}-\langle f \rangle^{2} \rangle} = \sqrt{\nabla^{T}_{x_{PV}} \rm{COV_{x_{PV}}} \nabla_{x_{PV}} + \nabla^{T}_{x_{SV}} \rm{COV_{x_{SV}}} \nabla_{x_{SV}} + \nabla^{T}_{p} \rm{COV_{p}} \nabla_{p}} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

which can be calculated analytically (method used for all the plots) or using numerical approximation of first derivative of \textit{finite differences}.

\section{Sources of Backgrounds \mybox{ULRIK}}
The largest background that can be will be looking similar to signal comes from \textit{cascade decays}, where semileptonic $b \rightarrow c \rightarrow s$ or ($\bar{b} \rightarrow \bar{c} \rightarrow \bar{s}$) transition occurs. A typical example of this background in hadronic terms is $B^{+} \rightarrow (\bar{D}^{0} \rightarrow (K^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{-} \nu) \mu^{+} \nu$), where $K^{+}$ is misidentified as muon. Because $K^{+}$ is misidentified as muon, this type of background is denoted as misID background.

In fact, any other particle species that is misidentified, belongs to the misID background category. If the sign of the misidentified particle agrees with the sign of the mother \Bpm, it belongs to the same sign misID background (\textit{SS misID}) background. In the event where opposite sign particle to the mother \Bpm is misidentified, this background will be referred to as (\textit{OS misID}) background. However, \textit{OS misID} background is expected to have smaller rate as the misidentified particle would have to proceed via decays with additional particles or if coming as product from other $b$ hadronization.

The presence of other \B-hadron from $b\bar{b}$ pair does create its own decay chain and hence it is possible to combine one of its muon tracks with two muons from the "signal" \B. This is denoted as combinatorial background.

Then presence of neutrino in a final state allows for certain uncertainty regarding the information of the fourth decay product. If some of the tracks of the decays are not reconstructed, either because they are neutral, or either they are charged but they are soft, it means that the missing information may be attributed to the neutrino. \textit{Missing tracks} will hence create partially reconstructed background. Some of the most dangerous are ${B^{+} \rightarrow D \mu^{+} \nu}$ type partially reconstructed backgrounds where $B^+ \rightarrow (D^0 \rightarrow K^- \pi^+ \mu^{+} \mu^{-})\mu \nu$, where $\mathcal{B}(D^0 \rightarrow K \pi^+ \mu^{+} \mu^{-}) \approx 4.17\times 10^{-6}$ and $B^{+} \rightarrow D^0 \mu \nu \approx 10 \%$. This predicts $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \pi^- \mu^+ \mu^{-} ) = 1\times10^{-7}$.

\section{Analysis strategy }%\mybox{ULRIK}}
\label{Strategy}

The analysis of the $B^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu_\mu$ decay is divided into several different parts; signal selection, optimisation, normalisation, fitting and limit setting. Throughout this document, charge conjugates of the decays are assumed unless stated otherwise. Results presented are based on the analysis of the full 3 fb$^{-1}$ Run 1 dataset as well $\approx$ 1.7 fb$^{-1}$ Run 2 data (not using 2015 dataset due to very low sensitivity (high muon trigger thresholds)). Additionally the search will be conducted in a particular min$q^{2}$ = min($q^{2}(\mu_{1}^{+},\mu^{-}), q^2(\mu^{-},\mu_{2}^{+})$) region.
\newline To perform the search for $B^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu_\mu$, a specific preselection was applied to form potential signal candidates. To reconstruct the mass of the $B^{+}$ with missing information about the neutrino, a corrected mass variable $M_{B_{corr}} = \sqrt{M_{3\mu}^{2} + |p^{2}_{\perp}|} + |p_{\perp}|$, where $M_{3\mu}^{2}$ is the invariant visible mass squared and $p^{2}_{\perp}$ is the missing momentum squared transverse to the direction of flight of $B^{+}$, is introduced. A simulation sample that mimics the decay of the $B^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu_\mu$ passing through preseletion was used to develop further discriminating selection. To get the selection efficiency for different types of backgrounds, different proxy samples are used. For more details about samples used see \autoref{Data}.
\newline Combinatorial background, which arises as random combinations of tracks passing the preselection, is taken from the upper corrected $\mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+}$ mass side band, $M_{Bcorr} > 5.5$ GeV, where very few signal candidates are expected.

\end{table}



Full phase space model, \textit{PHSP}, only takes into account the kinematic constraints of the decay without taking into account any input from theoretical considerations as the matrix element is constant and hence angular momentum is disregarded.

In order to produce simulation with decay model which is more representative of the spin structure involved, following strategy is adapted. In this simulation approach, the decay proceeds as follows: \Bpm decays into \Wpm and a pair of opposite sign muons and then \Wp is decayed to $\mu^{+} \nu$. \textit{BTOSLLBALL} model\cite{Ali:1999mm}, traditionally used for $\B \rightarrow (K,K^{*}) l^{+} l^{-}$ decay, with the form factor calculations can be used to simulate $\Bpm \rightarrow \Wpm l^{+} l^{-}$ decay. After that, \Wp is decayed to $\mu^{+} \nu$ using \textit{PHSP}. For semileptonic $b \rightarrow s l^{+} l^{-}$ transitions, there is a characteristic photon pole for low $q(\mu^{+},\mu^{-})$, invariant mass of the opposite muon pair, and flat distribution for $K^{*}(\mu^{+}, \nu_{\mu}) $, invariant mass of the muon and neutrino pair. In order to achieve this, a new pseudo-particle is introduced to EVTGEN with specific properties, $K^{*}(\mu^{+}, \nu_{\mu})$, and the best output can be seen to be for a particle $K^{*}(\mu^{+}, \nu_{\mu})$ with mass to be set to $0.1 \text{GeV/c}^{2}$, and width, corresponding to $\tau= 1.3\times10^{-17}$ nanoseconds as can be seen in \autoref{fig:mcgeneration}. This procedure was also applied for the charge conjugate case. This model is denoted as \textit{MINE} and is used as default in mass fits and efficiency calculations.

Finally, exclusively for this decay, a new decay model \textit{B2MuMuMuNu} was added to EVTGEN, based on work performed by theorist Nikola Nikitin (write more once theory chapter is done and refer to it.). This model denoted as \textit{NIKI}, is used mainly for validation purposes. 


\section{Preselection for \Bmumumu \mybox{ULRIK}}

Set of initial identification for signal \Bmumumu summarized in \autoref{tab:stripcutsB}, also known as \textit{stripping} selection was develloped in order to improve signal to background ratio. 

Firstly, all three muon tracks are required to have a significant \gls{IP} with respect to the primary vertex. Minimum Impact Parameter $\chi^{2}$, (\gls{minipchi2}), gives the minimum significance of a particles's trajectory to the primary vertex. Hence by requiring \gls{minipchi2}$>9$ for muons is consistent with the hypothesis that the muon is $3\sigma$ away from the primary vertex and hence can be well differentiated. In addition, the change in the $\chisq$ if \gls{PV} and \gls{SV} vertices are fitted separately as opposed to common vertex fit, \gls{fdchi2}, suppresses prompt backgrounds. 

Each muon track is required to have good track $\chi^{2}$ per number of degrees of freedom of the fit (\texttt{ndof}), (\gls{trackchi2ndof}), as well as low \gls{pgh2}. This removes spurious tracks as well as tracks with low quality.

Each muon candidate is also identified with initial basic \gls{PID} variables. Firstly muons are chosen due to their signature in the muons stations with the binary \texttt{isMuon} decision. Secondly, muons candidates are chosen such that it is more likely that the candidate is muon than pion or kaon using global DLLmu variables defined in \autoref{muonID}. This reduces the background from misidentified muons.

In order to only select events which are compatible with the three muons originating from the same point in the space, (\gls{vertexchi2ndof}), the $\chi^{2}$ of the trimuon vertex per degree of freedom fit required to be small. This decreases the contamination from \textit{cascade decays} where the particle with the $c$ quark content from $b \rightarrow \underline{c} \rightarrow s$, such as $D$, would have non-negligible lifetime leading to higher \gls{vertexchi2ndof}. 

Requiring that \Bp direction points in the same direction as the line from \gls{PV} to \gls{SV}, (\gls{DIRA} - which measures the angle between these two vectors), is close to unity translates into a well reconstructed event, which minimizes combinatorial background, where random track makes this pointing worse. Putting bounds on mass window, whether it is \textit{visible} or \textit{corrected} mass, also supresses combinatorial events. This is because of on average higher momentum combinatorial muon.

\end{table}

\section{Trigger Selection \mybox{ULRIK}}
In order to obtain triggered data, $B^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu_\mu$ candidates are required to pass certain set of trigger decisions at \gls{L0}, \gls{HLT1} and \gls{HLT2} levels summarized in \autoref{tab:triggersel}. It can be noted that the decision is applied at the mother \Bpm level. In particular, \texttt{Bplus$\_$L0MuonDecision$\_$TOS decision}, means that one of the muons from \Bpm in an event has triggered and made positive decision.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ l l}%l | l | }

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	\caption{Trigger selection applied on both signal and normalisation samples}
	\label{tab:triggersel}
\end{table}

As discussed in \autoref{triggerchap} \texttt{L0MuonDecision} decides on whether an event is accepted depending on the $p_{T}$ of muon and the number of hits in the \gls{SPD}. Run \Rn{1} can be split into 2011 and 2012 conditions where, in 2011 the most used threshold for positive decision is 1.48 \gevc \cite{Aaij:2012me} and 1.76 \gevc \cite{Albrecht:2013fba}. Run \Rn{1} \gls{SPD} rate only accepts events below 600. In Run \Rn{2}, the trigger thresholds varied more but the most representative acceptance for muon $p_{T}$ was above 1.85 \gevc with \gls{SPD} multiplicity below 450.

\texttt{Hlt1TrackMuonDecision} accepts events where mother particle has certain lifetime (which is case for $B,D$ mesons), by requiring certain \gls{ipchi2} of the track with respect to all of its \gls{PV}s. There has to be at least one muon (\texttt{isMuon==true}) in its final state with certain kinematic thresholds on $p$ and $p_{T}$. For example, in 2011 the identified muons that triggered positive decision had to have $p$ above 8 \gevc \cite{Aaij:2012me}.

At \gls{HLT2} level, the candidates are reqiured to pass through at least one of the four decisions. \texttt{Hlt2TopoMu[2,3]BodyBBDTDecision} belong to the \textit{topological triggers} category with extra requirement of muon being idendified by \texttt{isMuon} decision. \texttt{Hlt2DiMuonDetachedDecision} and \texttt{Hlt2DiMuonDetachedHeavyDecision} reconstruct decays with two muons in a final state, dimuon. The two lines differ in selection that is optimized either for heavy or light dimuon pair. For example, \texttt{Hlt2DiMuonDetachedDecision} accepts events with dimuon $p_{T}$ above 1.5 \gevc and with mass above 1 \gevcc, whereas  \texttt{Hlt2DiMuonDetachedHeavyDecision} accepts dimuon pairs with any $p_{T}$ but above 2.95 \gevcc in mass. The reason why these lines are called detached are because individual muons are required to have high \gls{ipchi2}.


\section{$q^{2}$ selection \mybox{ULRIK}}

In \Bmumumu, two pairs of opposite sign muons can be formed, namely $q^2(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ and $q^2(\mu_2,\mu_3)$ where $\mu_1=\mu^{+} , \mu_2=\mu^{-}, \mu_3=\mu^{+} $.
From the two invariant mass squared pairs one can define, $minq^2 = min[q^{2}(\mu_1,\mu_2), q^2(\mu_2,\mu_3)]$ and $maxq^{2} = max[q^{2}(\mu_1,\mu_2), q^2(\mu_2,\mu_3)]$. This measurement is made in region where $\sqrt{minq^{2}}={minq<980}$ \mevcc because of two main reasons: most of the contributions to the amplitude of the decay is below this value and combinatorial background is greatly reduced if $minq^{2}<1$ (\gevcc)$^{2}$, see \autoref{fig:qsqsel}.

In order to remove backgrounds that proceed via resonant $J/\psi$ and $\Psi(2S)$ contributions, vetoes in invariant mass are placed in the corresponding regions, see \autoref{tab:vetoes} for more details.

\section{Further Selection}

Further selection was performed as seen in \autoref{tab:OfflineSelection}. This selection further suppresses backgrounds but requires different treatement in 
Run \Rn{1} and Run \Rn{2} due to the different definitions of variables as seen in \autoref{bugs}.

\end{table}

	The sections below will outline multivariate techniques used in this analysis, the isolation BDT \autoref{isolationvar}, combinatorial BDT \autoref{CombiBDTsel} and misidBDT \autoref{misidbdt}.

As the background study of inclusive $b\bar{b}$ simulation sample shows that there will be two dominating backgrounds, combinatorial background and misID background. In order to reduce these backgrounds, two consecutive multivariate classifiers are used. The first multivariate classfier is developed to remove efficiently combinatorial background and a second multivariate classifier will help to control the contamination from misID decays. As one of the key variables that provide the greatest separation power is the isolation BDT.

Cross-validation is one of the useful methods used within MVAs which improves the chance of good performance of the predictive model on an independent dataset. In this way, biases due to simple sample split into training and testing subsample, could be overcome. In general, it helps also with overfitting when the model of the classifier is sensitive to fluctuations.  The cross-validation method used in both combinatorial BDT and misidBDT is known as \textit{k-folding} technique \cite{kfold}. 

In particular, both background and signal samples are randomly split into $k$ similar size subsamples. Then the BDT is trained on the $k-1$ signal/background subsamples, which are subsequently tested on the remaining last subsamples. This process is repeated $k$-times for all possible combinations, hence the name of cross-validation. In the last step, the $k$ results produced from $k$ folds are averaged yielding final estimate. In the two consecutive BDTs, number of folds used is $k$=10.

Both of the BDT classifiers use \texttt{AdaBoost} algorithm and same set of variables listed in \autoref{tab:vars}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l  l  l |} \hline
$B^{+} p$ & \gls{minipchi2} of all three muons & \gls{DIRA} \\
$B^{+}$ $p_T$ & $p_{T}$ of all three muons & $B^{+}$ \gls{fdchi2} \\ 
$B^{+}$ \gls{vertexchi2ndof} & \gls{minipchi2} of all three muons  & Isolation variable ~\autoref{isolationvar} \\
$B^{+}$ lifetime &  &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{BDT variables used in both combinatorial and misID Run \Rn{1} and Run \Rn{2} BDTs}
\label{tab:vars}
\end{table}


	After classifiers to reduce combinatorial and misid backgrounds are trained and applied, further \gls{PID} selection is performed. This can be done as the preselection has relatively loose \texttt{DLL} selection and hence it is possible to improve the performance by using cuts on additional \gls{PID} variables. In the optimisation, different hypotheses were tested, such as cuts on \texttt{Probnnmu}, \texttt{Probnnpi}, and \texttt{ProbnnK} variables and their combinations. Optimisation was performed in a such a way as to optimize Punzi figure of merit \texttt{(FOM)} \cite{Punzi:2003bu}, defined in \autoref{eq:punzifom},  in a blinded signal region, by performing full blinded data fit \mybox{make reference to this once it is written}, but with Run \Rn{1} and Run \Rn{2} fits separately.


Throughout the analysis the Punzi \texttt{FOM} is used to find optimal working point. It is defined,

\begin{equation}
	\texttt{FOM}=\frac{\varepsilon_{S}}{\sqrt{B}+\sigma/2},
	\label{eq:punzifom}
\end{equation}

where $\varepsilon_{S}$ is the signal efficiency of the selection and $B$ refers to the number of background candidates, $\sigma$ is the significance. In this case, the significance 3$\sigma$ is used. The advantage of this \texttt{FOM} to more conventional ones, is is insensitive to the knowledge of exact number of signal events, which is the case as the branching fraction is unknown.


In 2016, misID templates above 5800 \mevcc are not populated. Hence final 6 bins of corrected mass (5800 \mevcc -7000 \mevcc) are merged into 1. For each PID hypothesis, FOM was calculated. In both cases, in \Rn{1} and \Rn{2} \texttt{Probnnmu} $>$ 0.35 yielded highest \texttt{FOM}.

\subsection{The Isolation Boosted Decision Tree}
\label{isolationvar}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{./sel/Isolation.eps}\put(-70,60){(a)}%
\hspace*{1.0cm}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{./sel/Isolation_Signal.eps}\put(-70,60){(b)}
\caption{(a) An example of decay topology for background and (b) signal.}
\label{fig:isolation}
%\vspace*{-1.0cm}
\end{figure}
	
	
Vast majority of the backgrounds that share the possibility of contaminating \Bmumumu signal have one property in common: they have more tracks associated with the decay. It is hence possible to use multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques to establish how \textit{isolated} the signal trimuon vertex is as compared to background trimuon vertex as seen in \autoref{fig:isolation}

	
%	In an event, for both signal and misidentified background there is a possibility that neutral particles, charged tracks or even a combination of both cases had not been reconstructed in the given vertex.

The isolation quality of the vertex is determined using TMVA's \cite{Speckmayer:2010zz} implementation of Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) based on the \texttt{AdaBoost} algorithm. This regression algorithm classifies the event to be more signal-like or background-like according to different track and vertex properties, the \textit{isolation variables}.


The signal proxy for the isolation BDT was trained and tested with $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow p \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}$ simulation sample, where all tracks apart from the $p \mu^{-}$ signal tracks are taken into the account. Background sample was formed with $\Lambda^{0}_{b} \rightarrow (\Lambda_{c} \rightarrow p) \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}$ tracks, also disregarding the $p \mu^{-}$ tracks. The isolation BDT is based on these samples yield weights, which are computed in \cite{Aaij:2015bfa}, and are result of other's people work. These weights are however then applied parametrically on \Bmumumu signal and background proxies, as they share similar topology with respect to isolation propreties.

The \textit{isolation variables} for include track $p_T$, the opening angle between track's momentum and momentum of the combined signal/background visible system, the \gls{trackchi2ndof}, the ghost probability of the track \gls{pgh2}, \gls{ipchi2} of the track with respect to signal/background \gls{SV} and \gls{PV}.

The Isolation BDT response peaks between -1 and 0 for isolated tracks (signal-like) and between 0 and 1 for non-isolated tracks (background-like). The output of this BDT can be seen in ~\autoref{fig:isolation} for both types. Backrounds shown include combinatorial background and misID type background. In the analysis, there is no explicit selection on this variable, but it is used as one of the variables for the for other BDTs.

\caption{Isolation score for signal and backgrounds using 2016 samples. If isolation fails to find any other track in the event, by default it gives value -2.}
\label{fig:isolation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Combinatorial Boosted Decision Tree}
\label{CombiBDTsel}
One of the most prominent background is combinatorial background and to reduce its contamination while keeping signal as high as possible combinatorial BDT is trained.
To obtain combinatorial BDT discriminant, a simulated sample for signal and upper mass sideband data ($M_{B_{corr}}>5.5$ \gevcc) for background is used as training and testing samples. These samples have passed through all previous pre-selection, trigger and selection and are using variables mentioned in \autoref{tab:vars}.
As the branching fraction and hence the number of signal events is unknown, the Punzi \texttt{FOM}, defined in \autoref{eq:punzifom}, is used to find optimal working point. In this case, the significance 3$\sigma$ is used, but it was checked that there is no change to optimal working point if it is varied to $5\sigma$, as seen in \autoref{fig:punzifom}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./sel/Scaled_nice_FOM_Run1.pdf}%
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./sel/Scaled_nice_FOM_2016.pdf}%
	\caption{ Punzi \texttt{FOM} have the optimum working point at 0.47 for Run \Rn{1} and 0.54 for Run \Rn{2} as seen in both figures with violet line for $\sigma=3$ and $\sigma=5$.}
\label{fig:punzifom}
\end{figure}


The \texttt{FOM} is computed in mass region, $4.5\gevcc <M_{B_{corr}} <5.5$ \gevcc, which also known as blinded region. To estimate the number of background candidates in blinded region, final fit strategy described in \mybox{add reference to fit} is used to fit the data, yielding around $10000$ in Run \Rn{1}, and $9000$ combinatorial candidates in Run \Rn{2}. The yields are extracted from fits to data integrating the combinatorial part of the total background P.D.F in the blinded region.

In order to accomodate different offline selections between Run \Rn{1} and Run \Rn{2}, separate BDTs are trained for different Runs. Combined training of all of the datasets was also performed but it does not lead to any improvement. Results of the comparison between separate and combined trainings can be seen in ~\autoref{fig:separatetraining}. Different properties (such as number of trees) and variables (2-particle vertex) have been added to see whether improvement in discrimination is possible but here are the results that prove to be most optimal.


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./sel/final_comparison_from_root_combi_2.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of separate and combined training samples and performance on different datasets. Two vertical violet lines represent optimal cut points at signal efficiency, for Run \Rn{1} (0.47) and for 2016 (0.34) where the working point of the two BDTs are chosen. Separate training provide greater rejection power in 2016. In Run \Rn{1} training on both datasets provide comparable performance for given optimal signal efficiency. Taking into the account the fact that offline selection slightly differs for 2016, it is advantagous to keep training separately.}
%\vspace*{-1.0cm}
\label{fig:separatetraining}
\end{figure}




In both Combinatorial BDTs the most discriminating variables are the isolation variable ~\autoref{isolationvar}, $B^{+}$ \gls{vertexchi2ndof}, \gls{minipchi2} of the muons and $p_{T}$ of $B^{+}$. Combinatorial muon comes more from somewhere else in the event and hence its \gls{minipchi2} is worse as compared to the signal, making $B^{+}$ \gls{vertexchi2ndof} worse. Moreover, as this combinatorial muon comes from somewhere else, other tracks may accompany it making the isolation variable a good discriminant. It also tends to have higher momenum and hence $p_{T}$ of $B^{+}$ is higher. Distributions for these different variables can be seen in \autoref{fig:discombi}.

\label{fig:discombi}
\end{figure}


It is also important that there is no skewing of the mass distribution for the background as this could lead later to modelling issues with these different background components. This was checked by looking at the behaviour of BDT output in different bins of $M_{B_{corr}}$. If this value stays constant then the background will not be skewed, which is the case for Run \Rn{2} as seen \autoref{fig:flatnessofcombibdt}. This is also the case in Run \Rn{1}.

\end{figure}

\section{Misid Boosted Decision Tree}
\label{misidbdt}
In the same way, boosted decision tree was used to yield a classifier that distinguishes well between signal and misid background. The misid sample, that is used for training and testing, was obtained the same way as signal but with one of the muons not identified as muon. Rather, this third particle will be identified either as a proton, pion or kaon.  \mybox{talk about the misid parametrisation}. As before, Run \Rn{1} and Run \Rn{2} are trained and used separately on the relevant datasets \autoref{fig:separatetrainingmis}. Optimisation metric for this classifier was again was Punzi \texttt{FOM} in a signal region and hence number of background events need to be obtained. \textit{k-folding} technique was applied again to prevent overtraining.


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./sel/true_Misid_CompareTrainOnBothRun1and2016__COMPAREroccurvesDIFFERENTtrainings.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of separate and combined training samples and performance on different datasets. Optimal working point is chosen, see \autoref{fig:punzifommisid} and its corresponding signal efficiency in Run \Rn{1} is 0.44 and for 2016 0.37 denoted with violet line. As the performance is better for 2016 when the training is performed separately, the training is kept separately also to be consistent with previous methodology.}
%\vspace*{-1.0cm}
\label{fig:separatetrainingmis}
\end{figure}




To obtain number of background events, the default fitting strategy for misID is used \mybox{talk about the misid fit}, where the total yield need to be multiplied by 100 in order to counter balance the prescale used at pre-selection stage. To obtain the yield, the binned $\chi^{2}$ fit is used as these samples are weighted and need to be directly used for the blinded data fit, which requires correct knowledge of the correlations of the fit results. The results of the binned $\chi^{2}$ fits to the misID templates are summarized in \autoref{fig:beforemisiddatafit} yielding in Run \Rn{1} 2400 unparametrized candidates for misid events are expected to be polluting the signal window in the prescaled sample, and in Run \Rn{2} 2200 candidates are obtained.

\label{fig:beforemisiddatafit}
\end{figure}



Misid background can proceed also through combination of random muon and hence by applying the combinatorial BDTs on the misid samples, this component is reduced and misid sample that is left should consist of true cascade decays, as seen in \autoref{fig:combionmisid2016},

\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{fig:combionmisid2016}
\end{figure}

The performance of the two misID BDTs classifier are shown in . The most powerful variables that distinguish the signal from misid background are the kinematic properties of the misidentified muon, namely $p_{T}$, $p$ and \gls{minipchi2}. Misidentified muons tend to be softer than in the signal case as they come from cascades via $D^{0}$ and its excited states. The \gls{minipchi2} distribution will be different as the misid muon can proceed $D^{0}$, rather than directly from the $B$. The kinematic distributions are also different for the two real muons in signal and background misid. The real muon that has the same charge as $B$ tends to be softer for the signal case whereas the real muon that has opposite charge proceeding via $D$ will be harder, as seen \autoref{fig:dismisif}.
