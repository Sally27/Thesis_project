\section{Limit Setting}
As no significant signal is observed, limit for the $\mathcal{B}(\Bmumumu)$ is set. This is achieved by using the $CL_{s}$ method described in~\autoref{sensitivity} and the $CL_{s}$ $p$ values are shown in ~\autoref{fig:limitset} together with both expected and observed curves. In this limit setting procedure where simultaneous fits are used, the systematic uncertainties mostly affect the efficiency ratios. In order to incorporate the systematics uncertainties in the limit setting they are added as 1D Gaussian constraints on the relevant efficiency ratios when calculating limit. They are assumed to be 100\% correlated between the bins of fractional corrected mass error.
 This gives following limits summarised in~\autoref{tab:limits}, setting the limit $\mathcal{B}(\Bmumumu) < 1.1(1.4)\times 10^{-8}$ at $90\%(95\%)$ confidence level. As it can be seen, observed limit is better than expected limit resulting in a downward fluctuation of around 1$\sigma$ compared to the expected sensitivity.

\section{Conclusion}
A search has been performed for the rare decay \Bmumumu, using 4.7\invfb of proton-proton collision data collected by the \lhcb experiment. No signal is observed for \Bmumumu and an upper limit of $< 1.4\times 10^{-8}$ at 95\%~confidence level is set in the branching fraction, where the minimum of the two $\mumu$ mass combinations is below $980$\mevcc. This limit disagrees with a recent theoretical calculation based on the vector dominance model~\cite{Danilina:2018uzr}.The result of the simultaneous fit stacked together overlaid with the fit to the data, as well as fit under assupmtion with the signal strenght equal to $\mathcal{B}(\Bmumumu)=1.3\times 10^{-8}$ from~\cite{Danilina:2018uzr} can be seen in~\autoref{fig:signalfit}. Under the assumption that the decay is dominated by intermediate vector mesons, the limit for the full kinematic region stays the same.

    candidates with the fit overlaid. Samples with low and high
    corrected mass uncertainty are fitted as individual samples but
    are merged in the figure. As the signal yield is negative the total fit
    in red shows a downward fluctuation. The dashed line represents the fit
    result if the signal had the branching fraction predicted in~\cite{Danilina:2018uzr}.}

\section{Outlook}
Despite the fact that no signal was observed, a stringent limit on the $\mathcal{B}(\Bmumumu)$ was set. As mentioned in~\autoref{mydecay}, the naive estimate of $\mathcal{B}(\Bmumumu)=1.0\times 10^{-8}$ is therefore not to far from the set limit. At the moment of the writing \gls{LHCb} colledcted 8\invfb of data, which means that the dataset for the analysis doubled. So assuming that the same ratio of signal and background the improvement in the limit would be by a factor of $1/\sqrt(2)$ which would reach the naive estimate expectaction.
