hey - I think you need glossaries.sty for this to work out of the box - the Main file I have commented out all the main body so the only tex files needed to my not needing figures for you to run an example - 

in my home computer I have the glossary package installed under my texmf path - so I guess you acn either do that or try with a simple glossary.sty

The only files the are interesting here are the Main and the Title page and glossary I guess;)
